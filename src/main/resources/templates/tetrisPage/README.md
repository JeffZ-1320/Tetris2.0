# Tetris-FE-Template
 The front-end of the tetris game

Today, I tried to import the css and js bootstrap files. It was a success. However, as I got coding, I quickly realized that I forgot all the syntaxes and keywords. 

End up searching about .containers class, class/id, padding vs border vs margin, and the border class.

- .container class: in html the syntax will be \<p class="className">\</p>. The container can be fixed width, responsive and jumps in size at breakpoints. Or container-fluid, responsive and the container change with screen size. 
- class can be used multiple times; id can be used only once, purpose is to target a specific element. 
- border is the edge of the element (defines the size of the element); padding is the distance between content and the border; margin the distance outside of the element or distance between elements. 
  - ? it's said that two elements with 1em padding will have a combined 2em padding/distance; while 1em of margin only has 1em of combined margin.

Imported a bootstrap navbar template and started working on that. I had an issue with the **search bar not aligning to the right.** So, I will have to figure that out.
- I copied the template so that I can later go through each of the class or elements mentioned and gradually understand bootstrap.

Tired making the tetris game but found it harder than predicted because it uses JavaScript. Therefore, I re-paced myself to get caught up with JS and work from there. 
- Basic JS vide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw-SYSG-028
- I also need to understand columns and rows in bootstrap..
